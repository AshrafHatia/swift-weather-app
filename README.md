# WeatherApp

## üìú Overview

WeatherApp is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that provides users with current weather information for their chosen locations. The app fetches weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://api.openweathermap.org) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs, manage data in Swift, and build clean, responsive UI components using SwiftUI.

## Key Features

- **Current Weather Information:** Displays the current weather, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Location Search:** Allows users to search for and select different locations to view weather information.
- **Dynamic UI:** Uses SwiftUI to create a dynamic and responsive user interface that updates in real-time based on API data.

## ‚öì Key Learning Points

### 1. SwiftUI Development
- Developed a user-friendly interface using SwiftUI, leveraging its powerful and flexible UI components.

### 2. API Integration
- Gained experience in integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather data.
- Learned how to handle JSON parsing and manage asynchronous network requests in Swift.

### 4. Error Handling
- Implemented error handling to manage API errors and provide feedback to the user.
